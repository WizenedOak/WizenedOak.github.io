                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Emad, though most people call me Aleks. I graduated from George Washington University in 2024, where I 
                    studied Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I work as a software engineer building and 
                    maintaining large-scale enterprise systems designed to be reliable, efficient, and resilient.

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Virginia but spent most of my childhood overseas. I’m Egyptian-American, my mom is Egyptian and my 
                    dad is American, and I have one younger sister who I am very close with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of my father’s work with the Red Cross and later the U.S. Department of State, my family moved every 
                    two years. In total, I've lived in nine countries: the United States, Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia, Panama, Mexico, Serbia, 
                    Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Constant movement taught me adaptability early. It also gave me a deep appreciation for different perspectives, 
                    cultures, and ways of thinking - something that influences both how I collaborate and how I approach engineering 
                    problems today.

                <p>
                    Professionally, I work building systems that are structured and dependable. At J.P. Morgan Chase, I help modernize and maintain 
                    enterprise applications that process thousands of credit applications daily. Working in financial systems has strengthened 
                    my focus on scalability, reliability, and clear communication between teams.

                <p>
                    During college, I also worked as a research assistant exploring AI hardware optimization and as a learning assistant helping 
                    students grasp complex engineering concepts.

                <p>
                    One of my favorite things to do is to go traveling. Due to my upbringing I love getting the chance to see new places and experience
                    their culture. I also greatly enjoy running long distance and recently have picked up listening to Audiobooks, with my favorite genere
                    being Fantasy. In my free time I greatly enjoy playing video games with my friends, with recent favorites being Baldur's Gate III
                    and Rocket League. I have also found great enjoyment recently in working on my personal projects.
