In the end...I was not able to start it. But like srsly this will be the spot for my travel app, meant to be like a combo of been and idk some sort of photo collection/shared album type jawn."

Also I feel like the documentation for that one was so good so like why would I not use it and showcase some insane doucmentation and cool coding at the same time. But bottom of the list cause it is not polished at all."
