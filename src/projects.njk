{# Projects vision: 
I want there to be a wide card for each project maybe something like 2/3 of the screen in width 
and like 10% of the screen in height.

Each card will have some demo picture for the project and a brief description.

When the card is clicked it will take you to the project (either github or a website depending on how I end up hosting the application.)

<section class="projects_card_container">
    {% for project in projects %}
        <div class="projects_card">
            <img src="{{ project.img }}" alt="{{ project.alt }}" loading="lazy">
            <div class="projects_card_content">
                <h3>{{ project.title }}</h3>
                <p>{{ project.description }}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
