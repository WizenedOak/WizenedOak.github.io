{# Website Info vision: 
Nothing too fancy here, I want there to just be card with a description of how the website was built, 
technologies used, and credit given.

Credits: 
- Background map(https://mapstyler.dev4pgh.com/)
- Used for examples on design
    - https://www.jareddillard.com/
    - https://www.victoriapuck.com/
- various online resources for how to create and design various components

Maybe icons for the tech used (HTML, CSS, Nunjucks, 11ty, and JS) and when the icons are clicked it takes you to the home
page of the documentation for that tech.

        <h1>Website Info</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to look at my website. Alot of time went into the designing, coding, and 
            content creating for it, with me going through multiple iterations of it all. So it means a lot to me 
            that you took the time to explore and appreciate it. As ever, perfect is the enemy of good and I had to
            eventually stop coding, but this site is always a work in progress, if you notice anything or have any 
            suggestions feel free to reach out to me and let me know!
            <br><br>
            This website was made using HTML, Nunjucks, and some JavaScript for functionality and components, 
            CSS for styling, 11ty for static site generation, and github actions for building and deploying the site.
            More details on the technologies used can be seen by clicking the icons below. If you would like to see the 
            source code please click the github icon below!
            <br><br>
            As always, this site was not created in a vaccuum and I would like to give credit where it is due.
            <br>
            Firstly, the background map was created using https://mapstyler.dev4pgh.com/ created by the Dev4PGH team.
            <br>
            Secondly, design inspiration came from a variety of places with the main sources of inspiration being from:
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.victoriapuckkaram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- https://www.victoriapuckkaram.com/</a>
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.jareddillard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">- https://www.jareddillard.com/</a>
            <br>
            Finally, I utilized a wide variety of online resources and tutorials to figure out how to design various components
            in this code. Without these sources this site would likely not have gotten very far off the ground, and despite not
            being able to list them all due to the vast amount, I would like to thank them regardless.
