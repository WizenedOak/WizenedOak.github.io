            <h2>About This Site</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Thank you</strong> for taking the time to look at my website - I truly appreciate it. Alot of time went into the designing, coding, and 
                content creating for it, with me going through multiple iterations of it all. 
                <br><br>
                While no project is ever perfect, I believe in continuous improvement.  If you notice anything or have any 
                suggestions feel free to reach out to me and let me know!

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                As always, this site was not created in a vaccuum and I would like to give credit where it is due.
                <br><br>
                The background map was created using <strong><a href="https://mapstyler.dev4pgh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapstyler.dev4pgh.com</a></strong> created by the Dev4PGH team.
                <br><br>
                Design inspiration came from a variety of places with the main sources of inspiration being from:
                <br>
                - <strong><a href="https://www.victoriapuckkaram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">victoriapuckkaram.com</a></strong>
                <br>
                - <strong><a href="https://www.jareddillard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jareddillard.com</a></strong>
                <br><br>
                I also relied <strong>numerous community resources and tutorials</strong> to develop components on this site. 
                While there are too many to list individually, I would like to thank them regardless.
