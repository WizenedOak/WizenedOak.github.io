    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- <img class="headshot-picture" src="" alt="Headshot image of Emad Haskett"> -->
    <p>
      My name is Emad Haskett, though I go by Aleks. I'm a software engineer with a
      strong interest in building clean, reliable, and scalable systems. I enjoy working on 
      problems where performance, correctness, and long-term maintainability matter.
      <br><br>
      Outside of engineering, I enjoy traveling, spending time in nature, running, and 
      being with friends and family.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have 3 years of experience working primarily on backend and cloud-based systems, 
      with exposure to enterprise-scale and regulated financial environments.<br><br>

      At J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., I’ve contributed to modernizing legacy systems and building 
      maintainable, fault-tolerant services that support 15,000+ credit applications per day. 
      My work involves collaborating across multiple teams, translating business and client 
      requirements into technical solutions, and ensuring systems meet high standards for 
      availability, performance, and security. <br><br>
      
      Previously, I worked on proof-of-concepts involving stream processing, distributed systems,
      and cloud infrastructure, and contributed to research in low-power AI hardware and neural 
      network optimization during my time at George Washington University.
